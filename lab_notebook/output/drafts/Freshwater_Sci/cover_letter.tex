\opening{Dear Editor,}
 
Please consider our manuscript ``Leaf litter density and decomposition in small man--made ponds'' for publication in Freshwater science.  Our paper shows how small man--made ponds accumulate and retain leaf litter from their watersheds.  We show that these ponds have some of the lowest reported rates of leaf litter decomposition and that the ponds have a high density of leaf litter in their sediments.  Given the abundance of small man--made ponds, we feel that quantification of the dynamics of leaf litter processing in these systems is essential to understanding how humans are altering watershed organic matter cycling.

None of the data, text, or figures have been used in any other publications and we agree to pay all page charges associated with the publication of our manuscript. 

Thank you for considering our manuscript for publication and we look forward to your feedback.

\closing{Sincerely}
